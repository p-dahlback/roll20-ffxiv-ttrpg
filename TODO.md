* Look into automating "Advantage on next ability check"
  * Ability hit/crit rolls
  * Monk Form advantages on Physical abilities
* Handle effect expiry on other characters' turns (NIN Mug effect)

FIX
* (test consume + restore + removing augment ability)

* Reset attributes and abilities on phase via mod command
-- Ability section names need to be global
-- New global reset component

* Heal and damage buttons via FFXIVAddEffect mod
* Setting on sheet to disable FFXIVAddEffect integration

* Esuna - FFXIVAddEffect effect selector?
